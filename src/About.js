            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I'm Vakeem Devlin, a self-taught aspiring frontend web developer from Vancouver, Canada.
                Intially I started learning the basics of coding through some classes in college but shortly after I chose to take the risky road of being a self-taught developer.
                I built my coding arsenal by studying a plethora of different books, guides and tutorials online.
                What better way to learn code than from the web itself!
